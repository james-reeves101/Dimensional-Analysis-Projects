maggieData.R is the code I had previously used to analyse a different, simpler dataset with less markers that transformed fine and I was able to continue with analysis. The Dataset presented has a more complex panel and optimal_cofactor.R  is the code I experimented with to optimsise the transformation of the data, along with a couple of plot functions to visualise.
